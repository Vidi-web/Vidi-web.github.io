<h1>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h1>
<a href="index4.html">Characters</a>

<h2>Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students. However, shortly after founding the school, Slytherin had a falling out with the other founders about blood purity, and wanted to admit only pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic, and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and Half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three founders all disagreed, especially Gryffindor. Slytherin left the school, but not before secretly building the Chamber of Secrets. He foretold that only his own heir would be able to open it once they arrived at the school, and the heir would unleash a murderous basilisk living inside to purge the school of all Muggle-born students.</h2>

Only a true Gryffindor could pull out the sword from the Sorting Hat. The Sword of Gryffindor is first seen when it appears in the Sorting Hat in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry uses it then to kill a Basilisk. From then, until the summer before Harry's sixth year, it rests in a glass case in the Headmaster's office.</b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/a5/82/3da58203ee1cf64243b3ad234a750f13.jpg" height= "200px" width= "200px"></div>

<h1>The Story of 4 house ghosts.</h1>

<h2>The Story of Nearly Headless Nick-:</h2>
<h3>Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, aka Nearly Headless Nick, led a choppy life. He was originally born in the 15th century to a family of nobles, which he left at the age of 11 to attend Hogwarts. He was sorted into Gryffindor – the house that, hundreds of years later, he would go on to represent as house ghost.After Hogwarts, Nick found himself as a wizard at the royal court, who also knighted him. He was friendly with Muggles, including a lady-in-waiting from the court, Lady Grieve, who would ultimately be the cause of his doom. The story goes that Nick met Grieve while strolling in the park, and – being the friendly chap he was/is – insisted that he could fix her crooked teeth with magic. But the spell backfired, and she instead started to grow a tusk. Nick was then arrested and sentenced to death: a botched beheading that, because of a dull axe, took 45 hacks to kill him, but still didn’t sever his head from his body. Hence the nickname Nearly Headless Nick.</h3>

<h2>The Story of The Fat Friar-:</h2>
<h3>Not much is known about the Fat Friar. He’s fat, obviously. And a friar. But much of his life remains a mystery. What we do know is that he was born late into the tenth century, and was sorted into Hufflepuff at Hogwarts – and run by its founders. Some point after finishing his magical education, the Fat Friar – not his real name – joined a mendicant religion as a friar, meaning that he spent his life begging in the name of charity.A noble life for a noble man, but the Fat Friar’s kindness was to be his undoing. For his fellow clergy grew suspicious at his ability to cure the pox with nothing but a stick, and he was soon executed. His penchant for pulling rabbits out of the communion wine probably didn’t help either.</h3>

<h2>The Story of The Grey Lady-:</h2>
<h3>In death she’s known as the Grey Lady. In life she was Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of legendary witch Rowena Ravenclaw, who founded Ravenclaw house in 993.Helena’s relationship with her mother was complex. An ambitious witch in the shadow of a brilliant one, Helena envied her mother’s status and wisdom – which was enhanced by her enchanted diadem. A few years into her magical education, she betrayed her mother by stealing the diadem – believing it could make her powerful – and running away from Hogwarts. The betrayal embarrassed Rowena, who told no one that the diadem was missing. On her death bed, however, she did send a young man to find Helena, so she could see her daughter for one last time. That young man tracked her down to a forest in Albania, and what happened next would be her downfall...</h3>

<h2>The Story of The Bloody Baron-:</h2>
<h3>How the Bloody Baron became the Bloody Baron – an apparently dangerous ghost soaked in someone else’s blood – remained a mystery at Hogwarts for quite a while. It all began, however, with Helena Ravenclaw. The Baron, born into nobility in the late tenth century, was infatuated with Helena ever since they met at Hogwarts, though she always spurned his advances. Not much is known about the Baron beyond his involvement with Helena, but it’s clear that he was a hot-tempered young man.
When Helena ran away with her mother’s diadem, the Baron was asked to track her down: which he did, to a forest in Albania. With her cornered, the Baron pleaded with Helena to come back with him, but – in her own words – became ‘furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom’ and stabbed her to death. Rightly horrified at what he had done, he then used the same knife to kill himself – sentencing himself to an eternity of penance, soaked in Helena’s blood. He has since remained at Hogwarts as Slytherin'sghost.</h3>

<h2>Peeves, the school poltergeist</h2>
<h3>Well, that’s the thing. Strictly speaking Peeves wasn’t a ghost at all so we can’t be sure. Think mischief-maker with a penchant for ‘kinetic disturbances’. We do know that he reflects his nature, a seamless blend of humour and malice. Who knows? We’re not even sure he was ever alive like the other house ghosts, but many attempts have been made to remove Peeves from Hogwarts. One such attempt in 1876 went disastrously wrong and led to the whole school being evacuated. Peeves was named for being the pet-peeve of every Hogwarts caretaker ever. Also – ‘poltergeist’ roughly means ‘noisy ghost’ in German. </h3>
